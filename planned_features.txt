file analyzer features:


search comments
	remove or regex strings within the other parts of the code, along with variable names. this will allow us to search for comments without having exact matches

search function calls:
	check constants and variable names.
	drawbacks: you might need to whitelist/blacklist functions to get good results

search code indentation/structure:
	identify changes in indentation structure, can identify copied code or code that was written in another editor by another person (includes spaces/tabs)

search use of paranthesis
	includes if/then, do, while, and calls that only use strings such as print "abc"
	function calls, if it puts a space in between the function name and the args sometimes then it might be pasted
	function calls, spaces after the paranthesis and before the end

search use of string quotes
	allow use of 'a' character, but if it has another place where they didn't use "a" character then it's probably copied from somewhere
	if it switches in between "string" and 'string' then it might be copied

search change of variable naming style
	list   : strHungarian, lowerCamelCase, UpperCamelCase, lower_case
	ignore : SHOUTY_CAMEL_CASE

random statements inside the code, or duplicated
	if ( <not> SERVER) then end

switch of commenting style
	two sets, -- and // then --[[]] and /**/

switch of garry operators
	!= and ~= then && and and then || and or

switch of indexing arrays
	arra["shit"] vs arra.shit
