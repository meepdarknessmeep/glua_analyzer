glua_analyzer
=====

This utility is for analyzing people's glua files. It aims to find inconsistencies in the coding style and eventually it will find borrowed code.

To use this you have to run `node meme.js filename`

luaparse.js is a modified luaparse that allows glua code to be properly lexed. Use it freely.
